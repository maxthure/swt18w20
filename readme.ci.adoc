= Continuous Integration and Inspection

Your `master` branch will be continuously built and inspected by https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] and
https://www.sonarqube.org[SonarQube] instances hosted by the ST group.
The service is available from inside the TU network at https://st-lab-ci.inf.tu-dresden.de.

There is one account per group. Use the following login for both Jenkins and SonarQube:

* Username: `swt18w20`
* Password: `Kqv0xO36n2`

Tip: select *Keep me signed in* when logging in to Jenkins.
